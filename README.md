### Business Insights
1.  **Scale vs. Quality Paradox:** The data indicates an inverse relationship between the program's growth and its success rate. As the number of companies per batch increased, the overall success rate declined.
2.  **Top Industries by Success Rate:** Based on the data, the industries with the highest success rates are:
    1.  **Fintech** (2.35%)
    2.  **Consumer** (2.27%)
    3.  **Industrials** (1.89%)
3.  **Temporal Evolution:** The program's success rate peaked in its early years (2005â€“2012) with rates above 6%, before dropping to below 2% from 2017 onwards.
4.  **Program Phases:** The program's evolution can be segmented into three distinct phases:
    * **Boutique Phase (2005â€“2012):** Small batch sizes with high success rates.
    * **Scaling Phase (2013â€“2018):** Rapid growth in company numbers coupled with a decline in success rates.
    * **Mass Market Phase (2019â€“2025):** Very large cohorts and a continued low success rate.
